### Added
- **`StreamConfig::exclude_pids` / N-API `excludePids`.** System-loopback
  capture can exclude a set of pids in addition to `exclude_self`. Electron
  hosts render audio from a helper process, so excluding the addon's own pid
  was not enough on Linux and macOS. Linux: fan-in over every app output whose
  pid is outside the set. macOS: every pid is added to the tap's exclude list,
  resolved to its Core Audio process object once at capture start — a helper
  that has not yet rendered audio has no object and is not excluded, so open
  the capture while the app is already playing or reopen it when a helper
  appears. Windows: one process tree — `exclude_self` wins, otherwise the first
  pid.

### Fixed
- **Linux: fan-in capture no longer latches a half-linked node.** `try_link`
  now commits a target only once the capture stream's own input ports have all
  arrived, the target has every output port its node info declares (or, when
  the node has not declared a count, its currently visible ports are fully
  paired), and each channel the capture can take is paired; a `try_link` fired by the first
  input-port global used to link FL alone and never revisit the node, so stereo
  sources came through at half level with one channel missing.
- **Linux: libpulse clients now resolve to their own pid.** Stream nodes are
  bound and `application.process.id` is read from their info props (the
  registry `global` event omits it); `pipewire.sec.pid` remains the fallback.
  For every client speaking the PulseAudio protocol (Electron/Chromium, Zoom,
  …) `pipewire.sec.pid` is pipewire-pulse's pid, so those apps were listed as
  one process by `processes()` and could not be excluded individually.

## [0.3.0] - not yet released

### Added
- **Process enumeration: `flexaudio::processes() -> Result<Vec<ProcessInfo>>`.**
  Lists the processes that have an audio output session/stream and can be
  passed to per-process capture as `target_pid`. The calling process is
  excluded, entries are deduplicated by PID, and the list is sorted with
  actively-playing processes first. Idle/stopped processes stay on the list;
  whether something is playing now is `is_output_active`. `ProcessInfo`
  carries `pid`, `name` (always non-empty), and, when the OS exposes them,
  `executable`, `bundle_id` (macOS), and `is_output_active`.
  - **Linux:** PipeWire clients that own a `Stream/Output/Audio` node; the PID
    comes from the client's `pipewire.sec.pid` (the same resolution the
    capture backend uses); activity = node state `Running`. `executable` is
    the basename of `/proc/<pid>/exe`, falling back to `/proc/<pid>/comm`.
  - **Windows:** audio sessions on every active render endpoint
    (`IAudioSessionManager2`); activity = session state `Active`. Listing and
    capturing both require Windows build 20348 or later (Windows 11 /
    Windows Server 2022).
  - **macOS 14.4+:** process objects Core Audio knows about (including
    input-only processes), with bundle ID and
    `kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningOutput`; older macOS returns
    `Error::UnsupportedOsVersion`.
  - The call is read-only, triggers no permission prompt, and always returns
    within 3 seconds. `Ok(empty)` means per-process capture is available but
    no such process exists right now (not "nothing is playing"). `Err` means
    per-process capture is unavailable here, permission was denied, the OS
    did not answer in time, or a previous enumeration is still in progress.
  - Exposed in every binding: N-API `processes(): Promise<JsProcessInfo[]>`
    (libuv thread pool; does not block the JS event loop), C
    `flexaudio_processes` / `flexaudio_processes_free` (`FlexProcessInfo`,
    `FlexOutputActivity`), Python `flexaudio.processes()` (`ProcessInfo`, still
    synchronous), and `flexaudio-cli --list-processes`.
- **Secondary output tap:** `StreamConfig::secondary_output` renders the same
  capture in a second format (for example 48 kHz stereo for saving plus 16 kHz
  mono for recognition), pulled with `Stream::poll_secondary` as
  `SecondaryChunk`. The N-API binding can deliver it as signed 16-bit
  (`secondaryOutput.encoding: 's16'`, an `Int16Array`); quantization goes
  through the shared NaN/Inf-safe `flexaudio_core::quantize_i16`.
- **Recording clock:** `pts_ns` is a zero-based recording clock (0 at the first
  delivered chunk) that stays continuous across pause/resume and source
  switches. Primary and secondary chunks share the clock, so pair them by
  `pts_ns`, never by `seq` (each tap has its own counter).
- **Integrated VAD control (N-API):** `vadTap: 'primary' | 'secondary'`,
  `FlexStream.flushVad()` to close the open utterance (run automatically by
  `stop()`), and a 30 s `maxSpeechMs` default for the integrated VAD when the
  option is left unset (the standalone `Vad` keeps silero's unbounded default).
- Denoise now runs once on the shared 48 kHz normalized signal, so both the
  primary and the secondary tap receive denoised audio.

### Changed
- The N-API TypeScript declarations now type the callbacks:
  `openStream(options, onChunk: (chunk: JsAudioChunk) => void, onEvent?)` and
  `watchDevices(onEvent: (event: JsDeviceEvent) => void)` instead of the
  undefined `ChunkTsfn` / `EventTsfn` / `DeviceTsfn` names.
- **N-API `processes()` is async:** it returns `Promise<JsProcessInfo[]>`.
  Rejection uses the same error type and message as the former thrown error.
- **N-API `FlexStream.stop()` is async:** it returns `Promise<void>`. The
  promise resolves only after every `onChunk` queued before stop — including
  the last PCM and the `frames:0` terminator — has been delivered to JS. Do
  not block synchronously inside `onChunk`, or terminator delivery and
  `stop()` resolution can stall.

### Migration from 0.2
- **Rust `StreamConfig` literals:** the struct gained `secondary_output`. A
  literal that lists every field without `..Default::default()` no longer
  compiles; add `secondary_output: None` or end the literal with
  `..Default::default()`.
- **N-API chunk delivery:** `onChunk` receives **one** argument. With
  `secondaryOutput` set, the paired secondary chunk is `chunk.secondary` (it is
  `undefined` on rounds where it has not arrived yet) — it is **not** a second
  callback argument. Code written as `(primary, secondary) => …` always sees
  `secondary === undefined`. VAD events ride on the chunk of the tap chosen by
  `vadTap`: `chunk.vadEvents` for `'primary'`, `chunk.secondary?.vadEvents` for
  `'secondary'`.
- **Timestamps:** treat `pts_ns` as time since the recording started, not as a
  host monotonic timestamp.
- **Integrated VAD:** if you relied on unbounded utterances, pass
  `vad.maxSpeechMs: 0` explicitly.
- **Process pickers:** list candidates with `processes()` instead of deriving
  them from `devices()` (which lists endpoints, never processes).
- **N-API `processes()`:** `await processes()` (it is no longer synchronous).
- **N-API `FlexStream.stop()`:** `await stream.stop()` so the last PCM and the
  `frames:0` terminator have been delivered before you tear down.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-17

The first Rust workspace release — a ground-up Rust rewrite of the earlier prototype.

### Added
- **Complete capture matrix ("9 cells"):** microphone, system-output loopback,
  and per-process capture across Linux, Windows, and macOS.
  - **Linux:** PipeWire backend for system and per-process capture
    (`flexaudio-os-linux`); cpal/ALSA microphone.
  - **Windows:** WASAPI loopback (system) and WASAPI process loopback
    (`flexaudio-os-windows`); cpal/WASAPI microphone.
  - **macOS:** Core Audio process taps for system and per-process capture
    (`flexaudio-os-macos`); cpal/CoreAudio microphone.
- **Unified facade `flexaudio`:** `open(StreamConfig)`, `devices()`, and
  `watch_devices()` pick the right backend by source + OS.
- **Pull-based streaming:** `Stream::poll_chunk` / `Stream::poll_event` deliver
  interleaved `f32` chunks (with `frames`, `peak`, `rms`, `seq`, `flags`) and
  stream events without callbacks.
- **Hot source switching:** `Stream::switch_source` swaps the input source while
  running; `seq` stays continuous and the first post-switch chunk is flagged as
  a discontinuity.
- **Device hotplug:** `watch_devices()` emits added / removed / default-changed
  events (PipeWire registry on Linux; no-op elsewhere for now).
- **Two-stage output formatting:** internal normal form resampled to a
  user-chosen `OutputFormat` (sample rate + channels) via `rubato`.
- **`flexaudio-vad`:** offline Silero VAD add-on with embedded ONNX model;
  streaming `SpeechStart`/`SpeechEnd` and batch `get_speech_timestamps`.
- **`flexaudio-cli`:** reference capture tool with WAV output and raw-PCM
  streaming to stdout (`--out -`) for real-time pipelines.
- **`flexaudio-napi`:** Node.js N-API addon (published to npm) for in-process
  use from TypeScript/Electron.

### Packaging
- Added `LICENSE` (MIT) at the workspace root and in each crate.
- Added `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` covering the bundled Silero VAD model,
  statically linked ONNX Runtime, dynamically linked PipeWire/libspa, and the
  permissive Rust dependency set.
- Filled in crate metadata (`description`, `keywords`, `categories`, `readme`,
  `documentation`, `authors`) for crates.io publication.
- Declared per-crate MSRV: `1.85` for core/facade/OS/mic crates, `1.88` for
  `flexaudio-vad` and `flexaudio-napi`.
