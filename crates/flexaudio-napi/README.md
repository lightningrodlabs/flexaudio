Native **N-API** bindings that let Node.js / TypeScript / Electron capture audio
through the [flexaudio](https://github.com/Studio-Sadola/flexaudio) Rust library:
microphone, system output (loopback), and per-process capture on **Linux**,
**Windows**, and **macOS**.

Three offline audio add-ons are compiled into the same binary and exposed to
JavaScript: **voice activity detection** (Silero VAD on pure-Rust tract),
**noise suppression** (RNNoise), and streaming **FLAC** encoding. They run fully
offline — no model files to ship, no network at runtime.

> This is the **npm** package for flexaudio (the Rust crate `flexaudio-napi`).
> It is **not** published to crates.io; consume the core library from Rust via
> the `flexaudio` crate instead.

## Install

```sh
npm install @lightningrodlabs/flexaudio
```

The correct prebuilt native binary for your platform is pulled in automatically
via the platform-specific `optionalDependencies` (`@lightningrodlabs/flexaudio-<triple>`).

## Usage

```js
const { devices, openStream } = require('@lightningrodlabs/flexaudio');

console.log(devices());

const stream = openStream(
  { kind: 'mic', outputRate: 48000, outputChannels: 2, chunkMs: 20 },
  (chunk) => {
    // chunk.data: Float32Array (interleaved), chunk.frames, chunk.peak, chunk.rms,
    // chunk.seq: BigInt, chunk.flags, chunk.droppedBefore
  },
  (event) => {
    // event.type: 'chunkDropped' | 'stalled' | 'recovered' | 'permissionDenied'
    //           | 'deviceLost' | 'error'
  },
);

// later:
await stream.stop();
```

`stream.switchSource(options)` hot-swaps the input source without stopping.
`watchDevices(cb)` reports hotplug (added / removed / defaultChanged) events.

## Picking a process to capture

`processes()` lists the processes that have an audio output session/stream and
can be captured per process. Idle/stopped processes are included; whether
something is playing now is `isOutputActive`. Pass `pid` as `processId`:

```js
const { processes, openStream } = require('@lightningrodlabs/flexaudio');

const list = await processes();
// [{ pid: 4242, name: 'Firefox', executable: 'firefox', isOutputActive: true }, …]
// bundleId is set on macOS only; executable / isOutputActive are undefined when
// the OS does not expose them. The calling process is never listed.

const target = list[0];
if (target) {
  const stream = openStream({ kind: 'process', processId: target.pid }, (chunk) => {});
  // …
  await stream.stop();
}
```

An empty array means per-process capture works but no such process exists right
now (not "nothing is playing"). A rejection means per-process capture is
unavailable here (Linux without a reachable PipeWire session, macOS before 14.4,
an unsupported OS, or a permission denial), the OS did not answer within 3
seconds, or a previous enumeration is still in progress. On Windows, listing
and capturing both need Windows build 20348 or later (Windows 11 / Windows
Server 2022).

## Excluding your own app (Electron hosts)

`excludeSelf: true` excludes the process the addon runs in. Electron and
Chromium render audio from a *helper* process, so also pass every pid of your
process tree:

```js
const pids = app.getAppMetrics().map((m) => m.pid);   // main + helpers
const stream = openStream({ kind: 'system', excludeSelf: true, excludePids: pids }, onChunk, onEvent);
```

Linux and macOS exclude every listed pid. Windows excludes one process *tree*
(`excludeSelf` wins, otherwise the first pid) — for an Electron host that is
the whole app, since helpers are children of the main process.

On **macOS** each pid is resolved to a Core Audio process object once, when the
capture starts. A helper that has not yet rendered any audio has no such object
and is therefore not excluded. Open the capture while the app is already
playing, or reopen it when a new helper appears.

## Chunk delivery shape (primary, secondary, VAD)

`onChunk` is called with **one** argument, the primary chunk. When
`secondaryOutput` is set, the paired secondary chunk travels **inside** it as
`chunk.secondary` — it is not a second callback argument. VAD events ride on the
chunk of the tap selected by `vadTap`. Do not block synchronously inside
`onChunk` (defer heavy work); blocking stalls terminator delivery and delays
`stop()` resolving.

```js
const stream = openStream(
  {
    kind: 'system',
    outputRate: 48000, outputChannels: 2,                       // primary: save
    secondaryOutput: { rate: 16000, channels: 1, encoding: 's16' }, // secondary: recognize
    vad: { threshold: 0.5 },
    vadTap: 'secondary',
  },
  (chunk) => {                    // ONE argument
    save(chunk.data);             // Float32Array, 48 kHz stereo
    const sec = chunk.secondary;  // undefined on rounds where it has not arrived yet
    if (sec) {
      recognize(sec.data);        // Int16Array because encoding is 's16'
      for (const ev of sec.vadEvents ?? []) {
        // ev.type: 'speechStart' | 'speechEnd'; ev.atNs: time since recording start
      }
    }
    // With vadTap: 'primary' (the default) the events are on chunk.vadEvents instead.
  },
);
```

Pair primary and secondary chunks by `ptsNs` (a zero-based recording clock),
never by `seq`: each tap counts its own sequence, and the secondary tap runs
about 20–60 ms behind the primary.

`stream` also exposes `pause()` / `resume()`, `setGain(x)`, and the read-only
`isPaused()`, `gain()`, `nativeFormat()` (`{ sampleRate, channels }`) and
`droppedChunks()` (a `bigint` running total).

## Voice activity detection, noise suppression, FLAC

The add-ons work standalone on any `Float32Array` of interleaved samples, and the
VAD / noise suppression can also be wired into a live `openStream`.

```js
const { Vad, Denoiser, FlacEncoder, openStream } = require('@lightningrodlabs/flexaudio');

// VAD: feed any format; it resamples internally to the VAD rate (16 kHz).
const vad = new Vad({ threshold: 0.5, minSilenceMs: 100 });
for (const ev of vad.process(samples, 48000, 2)) {
  // ev.type: 'speechStart' | 'speechEnd'
  // ev.atSample is on the VAD's internal rate — seconds = ev.atSample / 16000
}

// Noise suppression: 48 kHz only, returns the denoised copy (mono here).
const dn = new Denoiser(1);
const clean = dn.process(samples);   // same length as input (one-frame delay)
const tail = dn.flush();             // final 480 samples/ch when you're done

// FLAC: streaming encode. splitSeconds > 0 rotates into meeting-001.flac, -002…
const flac = FlacEncoder.create('meeting.flac', 48000, 2, /* splitSeconds */ 600);
flac.writeChunk(samples);
flac.finalize();
```

Integrated into a recording, `denoise` rewrites the delivered/stored audio and
`vad` attaches its events to each chunk (as `chunk.vadEvents`), applied in the
order denoise → VAD:

```js
const stream = openStream(
  { kind: 'mic', outputRate: 48000, denoise: true, vad: { threshold: 0.5 } },
  (chunk) => {
    // chunk.data is already noise-suppressed; chunk.vadEvents holds VAD events
  },
);
```

`denoise` requires `outputRate: 48000` (RNNoise is 48 kHz only) — any other rate
makes `openStream` throw.

## Building the loader (`index.js` / `index.d.ts`)

The JavaScript loader (`index.js`) and TypeScript declarations (`index.d.ts`)
follow the **napi-rs** convention and are **generated** by the napi CLI from the
`#[napi]` exports in `src/lib.rs`:

```sh
npm install
npx napi build --platform --release   # also produces the .node binary
```

`napi build` writes `index.js`, `index.d.ts`, and the platform `.node` artifact.
`index.js` and `index.d.ts` are committed (regenerate them after changing the
`#[napi]` exports); the `.node` binaries are git-ignored. Do not hand-edit the
generated files — change the doc comments in `src/lib.rs` and rebuild.

## Permissions

Audio capture requires OS-level consent: macOS TCC
(`kTCCServiceAudioCapture`; add `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` to your app's
`Info.plist`), the Windows microphone privacy setting, and a running PipeWire
session on Linux for system / per-process capture. See the
[workspace README](https://github.com/Studio-Sadola/flexaudio#os-specific-permission-requirements).

On macOS, system / per-process loopback (Core Audio process taps) requires
macOS 14.4 or later.
